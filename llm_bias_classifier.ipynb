Flynn resigned Monday night after reports he misled the vice president-elect about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.\\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\\nTwenty-five days - that's how long Michael Flynn lasted as national security adviser. New details are emerging today about his ouster. He now admits that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. At issue is whether he promised that the U.S. would ease sanctions imposed by the Obama administration.\\nKELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\\nWhite House Spokesman Sean Spicer said today President Trump asked for Flynn's resignation and got it.\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\\nSEAN SPICER: We got to a point not based on a legal issue but based on a trust issue where the level of trust between the president and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change.\\nMCEVERS: Flynn's departure leaves a vacuum at the top of the National Security Council. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly reports on the upheaval inside the NSC and what's not getting done with all of Washington distracted.\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Here's one way of looking at Flynn's departure. Maybe not much will change.\\nPHILIP GORDON: To be honest, even before Flynn's resignation, was scene at the NSC was fairly chaotic.\\nKELLY: That's Philip Gordon, a veteran of both the Obama and Clinton National Security Councils. He points to reports of dysfunction. Still, he says the national security adviser plays an essential role in briefing the president every day. Gordon says when the job is not filled or not filled well, you get trouble.\\nGORDON: If you just think about the inbox of the president today on Iran and Ukraine and the South China Sea and North Korean tests and Egypt and Yemen and Afghanistan and NAFTA and Islamic State strategy and safe zones in Syria, I mean you could go - the volume that goes across the national security adviser's desk is extraordinary. And every one of those issues is extraordinarily complicated and fraught with risk.\\nKELLY: Want an urgent example of what could go wrong without a steady national security adviser at the helm? Phil Gordon says look at tomorrow. Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu is visiting the White House. Sure, Gordon says Trump has other advisers to help him prep, but Trump will not benefit from the detailed and careful process that Gordon says is the signature of the NSC.\\nGORDON: And I can guarantee you that Prime Minister Netanyahu will be more prepared for the meeting than President Trump. You know, that leads to U.S. foreign policy mistakes.\\nKELLY: We should note there is an acting national security adviser in place. That's retired General Keith Kellogg. And Fran Townsend, veteran of George W. Bush's National Security Council, says it's nonsense to think that Flynn's absence will automatically lead the whole enterprise to go off the rails.\\nFRAN TOWNSEND: The business of the country continues to get done. It doesn't stop because one person walks out the door.\\nKELLY: Townsend served as President Bush's homeland security adviser. She says the timing of Flynn's resignation is unfortunate - just three weeks in. But she argues the palace intrigue won't have a serious impact.\\nTOWNSEND: This is Washington's favorite parlor game, right? I think we on the outside spend a lot more time on this sort of nonsense than you do when you have the nation's business that you're responsible for. I mean I just don't think the people - the substantive people in the White House have the luxury of the parlor game. They just don't.\\nKELLY: Townsend predicts calmer waters ahead for the Trump White House. Adam Schiff does not. He's the California congressman who's the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Schiff believes the Russia trail does not end with Michael Flynn, that it leads deeper and higher in the White House. Schiff says he's troubled in particular by this question.\\nADAM SCHIFF: Was Flynn acting at the president's behest? Was he acting with the president's knowledge?\\nKELLY: Because if that were true...\\nSCHIFF: Then you have the president of the United States, the prospect of the president of the United States lying to the public about contacts with one of the principal threats to the country, that being Russia. That's about as serious as it gets in the national security realm.\\nKELLY: Trump Spokesman Sean Spicer categorically denied this charge today, saying the president did not direct Flynn to talk about sanctions. That's a month and a day after Spicer categorically denied that Michael Flynn ever discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador. Mary Louise Kelly, NPR News, Washington.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2017 NPR.

Its form was inseparable from the thrill of transatlantic air travel. For a generation of international travelers, it was a memorable first impression of America, an Ellis Island for the jet age.\\nIt was the world\\u2019s most famous airport terminal 1, and the most beloved project of the mid-century architect Eero Saarinen 2. Likened to a bird taking off, the TWA Flight Center at New York\\u2019s Kennedy airport comprises four vaulted concrete shells perched lightly on the ground. There are few walls; instead, the exterior is dominated by canted banks of windows.\\nIn 1962, when its opening was broadcast on national TV, the Trans World Flight Center was the most distinctive example of corporate-showpiece architecture, a movement led by Saarinen himself, with projects such as the General Motors Technical Center, in Warren, Michigan, and IBM\\u2019s research center north of New York City. \\u201cLike a good advertising agency,\\u201d the critic Reyner Banham wrote of Saarinen that year, \\u201che bestowed status, improved the image.\\u201d\\nYet even as the terminal captured the futuristic spirit of the \\u201960s, it was soon rendered out-of-date by the demands of larger planes and crowds. Annexes were built to accommodate the jumbo jet; as security requirements changed, a phalanx of metal detectors was added, cutting the atrium in two and creating lines that sometimes stretched through the terminal\\u2019s doors. By the time TWA went out of business, in 2001, the building suffered from a predicament common to iconic mid-century architecture: It was too useless to live, and too beautiful to die.\\n4 Ike Edeani\\nFor the next 15 years, preservationists, developers, and the Port Authority\\u2014which manages the airport\\u2014engaged in a tug-of-war over the building\\u2019s future. Structurally inflexible and costly to restore, decaying mid-century landmarks by Paul Rudolph, Richard Neutra, and others were being demolished. If anything, the Flight Center seemed even less likely than these to survive. But in 2015, on its third attempt, the Port Authority finally found a developer willing to take a 75-year lease on the terminal. MCR Development, which owns dozens of hotels, proposed a restaurant-hotel-conference-center complex around the Flight Center; the project broke ground in December.\\n5 Phillip Harrington / Alamy\\nThere are some challenges to rehabilitating 4 a structure that has more in common with a sculpture 5 than with your average transportation facility. The panels of quarter-inch-thick, nontempered glass that form the building\\u2019s windows, for example, have been dropping from their brittle, aging gaskets and shattering like ice on the ground. They must be replaced, a routine task complicated by the fact that no two of the 486 panels 6 have the same dimensions. The roughly 4 million custom-made ceramic tiles 7 that cover the terminal\\u2019s floors, walls, and steps are cracked and worn; many of them are being replaced.\\n6 Ike Edeani\\n\\u201cThe whole world is a giant Walgreens now,\\u201d Tyler Morse, the CEO of MCR, told me when I visited the terminal recently. \\u201cWhen you go to Paris, London, New York, or St. Louis, it\\u2019s the same restaurant chains, the same supermarkets. As the world becomes more homogenized, people become interested in a unique product.\\u201d\\n7 Ike Edeani\\nThis particular product will be not only unique but costly: With a budget of $265 million, it is likely to be the world\\u2019s most expensive airport hotel. Bulldozers are now digging out a 50,000-square-foot subterranean event space, which will sit below and behind the old terminal. Flanking the landmark will be two six-story buildings 8, which will hold the hotel\\u2019s 505 guest rooms (expected to start at about $250 a night), a rooftop swimming pool, and an observation deck, from which visitors will be able to watch planes take off.\",\n          \"Former FBI Director James Comey leaves a closed session with the Senate Intelligence Committee in the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill June 8, 2017 in Washington, D.C. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\\nFormer FBI Director James Comey sharply criticized Republicans, and by extension President Donald Trump, shortly after the House Intelligence Committee released the controversial memo that supposedly shows bias at the FBI and the Justice Department. It seems Comey, agrees with Slate\\u2019s Jeremy Stahl that the memo is a \\u201ccomplete flop\\u201d and \\u201coffers virtually no new information.\\u201d\\nIn a tweet, Comey point-blank asks: \\u201cThat\\u2019s it?\\u201d The partisan wrangling that preceded the release of the \\u201cdishonest and misleading\\u201d memo caused significant damage but doesn\\u2019t actually show any kind of malfeasance, the former FBI chief suggested. The debate over the document that has engulfed Washington for weeks \\u201cwrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen,\\u201d Comey wrote. \\u201cFor what? DOJ & FBI must keep doing their jobs.\\u201d\\nThat\\u2019s it? Dishonest and misleading memo wrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen. For what? DOJ & FBI must keep doing their jobs. \\u2014 James Comey (@Comey) February 2, 2018\\nThe normally quiet Comey who usually likes to comment on the news in roundabout ways has been unusually direct recently. On Thursday evening, the former FBI director also took to Twitter to say that everyone \\u201cshould appreciate the FBI speaking up.\\u201d Ultimately though, Comey, whose firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel, sounded an optimistic tone: \\u201cTake heart: American history shows that, in the long run, weasels and liars never hold the field, so long as good people stand up. Not a lot of schools or streets named for Joe McCarthy.\\u201d\\nAll should appreciate the FBI speaking up. I wish more of our leaders would.

Not a lot of schools or streets named for Joe McCarthy. \\u2014 James Comey (@Comey) February 1, 2018\\nThe FBI and Justice Department had staunchly opposed the release of the memo and there were reports that the White House was worried FBI Director Christopher Wray would resign with the release of the memo. But later reports claimed Wray had \\u201cno intention of quitting.\\u201d\\nBREAKING: FBI Director Chris Wray has no intention of quitting if controversial House Intel memo is released despite his objections, @PeteWilliamsNBC reports \\u2014 NBC Politics (@NBCPolitics) February 1, 2018\\nSome are urging the FBI director to reconsider.

Flynn resigned Monday night after reports he misled the vice president-elect about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.\\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\\nTwenty-five days - that's how long Michael Flynn lasted as national security adviser. New details are emerging today about his ouster. He now admits that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. At issue is whether he promised that the U.S. would ease sanctions imposed by the Obama administration.\\nKELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\\nWhite House Spokesman Sean Spicer said today President Trump asked for Flynn's resignation and got it.\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\\nSEAN SPICER: We got to a point not based on a legal issue but based on a trust issue where the level of trust between the president and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change.\\nMCEVERS: Flynn's departure leaves a vacuum at the top of the National Security Council. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly reports on the upheaval inside the NSC and what's not getting done with all of Washington distracted.\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Here's one way of looking at Flynn's departure. Maybe not much will change.\\nPHILIP GORDON: To be honest, even before Flynn's resignation, was scene at the NSC was fairly chaotic.\\nKELLY: That's Philip Gordon, a veteran of both the Obama and Clinton National Security Councils. He points to reports of dysfunction. Still, he says the national security adviser plays an essential role in briefing the president every day. Gordon says when the job is not filled or not filled well, you get trouble.\\nGORDON: If you just think about the inbox of the president today on Iran and Ukraine and the South China Sea and North Korean tests and Egypt and Yemen and Afghanistan and NAFTA and Islamic State strategy and safe zones in Syria, I mean you could go - the volume that goes across the national security adviser's desk is extraordinary. And every one of those issues is extraordinarily complicated and fraught with risk.\\nKELLY: Want an urgent example of what could go wrong without a steady national security adviser at the helm? Phil Gordon says look at tomorrow. Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu is visiting the White House. Sure, Gordon says Trump has other advisers to help him prep, but Trump will not benefit from the detailed and careful process that Gordon says is the signature of the NSC.\\nGORDON: And I can guarantee you that Prime Minister Netanyahu will be more prepared for the meeting than President Trump. You know, that leads to U.S. foreign policy mistakes.\\nKELLY: We should note there is an acting national security adviser in place. That's retired General Keith Kellogg. And Fran Townsend, veteran of George W. Bush's National Security Council, says it's nonsense to think that Flynn's absence will automatically lead the whole enterprise to go off the rails.\\nFRAN TOWNSEND: The business of the country continues to get done. It doesn't stop because one person walks out the door.\\nKELLY: Townsend served as President Bush's homeland security adviser. She says the timing of Flynn's resignation is unfortunate - just three weeks in. But she argues the palace intrigue won't have a serious impact.\\nTOWNSEND: This is Washington's favorite parlor game, right? I think we on the outside spend a lot more time on this sort of nonsense than you do when you have the nation's business that you're responsible for. I mean I just don't think the people - the substantive people in the White House have the luxury of the parlor game. They just don't.\\nKELLY: Townsend predicts calmer waters ahead for the Trump White House. Adam Schiff does not. He's the California congressman who's the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Schiff believes the Russia trail does not end with Michael Flynn, that it leads deeper and higher in the White House. Schiff says he's troubled in particular by this question.\\nADAM SCHIFF: Was Flynn acting at the president's behest? Was he acting with the president's knowledge?\\nKELLY: Because if that were true...\\nSCHIFF: Then you have the president of the United States, the prospect of the president of the United States lying to the public about contacts with one of the principal threats to the country, that being Russia. That's about as serious as it gets in the national security realm.\\nKELLY: Trump Spokesman Sean Spicer categorically denied this charge today, saying the president did not direct Flynn to talk about sanctions. That's a month and a day after Spicer categorically denied that Michael Flynn ever discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador. Mary Louise Kelly, NPR News, Washington.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2017 NPR.

Its form was inseparable from the thrill of transatlantic air travel. For a generation of international travelers, it was a memorable first impression of America, an Ellis Island for the jet age.\\nIt was the world\\u2019s most famous airport terminal 1, and the most beloved project of the mid-century architect Eero Saarinen 2. Likened to a bird taking off, the TWA Flight Center at New York\\u2019s Kennedy airport comprises four vaulted concrete shells perched lightly on the ground. There are few walls; instead, the exterior is dominated by canted banks of windows.\\nIn 1962, when its opening was broadcast on national TV, the Trans World Flight Center was the most distinctive example of corporate-showpiece architecture, a movement led by Saarinen himself, with projects such as the General Motors Technical Center, in Warren, Michigan, and IBM\\u2019s research center north of New York City. \\u201cLike a good advertising agency,\\u201d the critic Reyner Banham wrote of Saarinen that year, \\u201che bestowed status, improved the image.\\u201d\\nYet even as the terminal captured the futuristic spirit of the \\u201960s, it was soon rendered out-of-date by the demands of larger planes and crowds. Annexes were built to accommodate the jumbo jet; as security requirements changed, a phalanx of metal detectors was added, cutting the atrium in two and creating lines that sometimes stretched through the terminal\\u2019s doors. By the time TWA went out of business, in 2001, the building suffered from a predicament common to iconic mid-century architecture: It was too useless to live, and too beautiful to die.\\n4 Ike Edeani\\nFor the next 15 years, preservationists, developers, and the Port Authority\\u2014which manages the airport\\u2014engaged in a tug-of-war over the building\\u2019s future. Structurally inflexible and costly to restore, decaying mid-century landmarks by Paul Rudolph, Richard Neutra, and others were being demolished. If anything, the Flight Center seemed even less likely than these to survive. But in 2015, on its third attempt, the Port Authority finally found a developer willing to take a 75-year lease on the terminal. MCR Development, which owns dozens of hotels, proposed a restaurant-hotel-conference-center complex around the Flight Center; the project broke ground in December.\\n5 Phillip Harrington / Alamy\\nThere are some challenges to rehabilitating 4 a structure that has more in common with a sculpture 5 than with your average transportation facility. The panels of quarter-inch-thick, nontempered glass that form the building\\u2019s windows, for example, have been dropping from their brittle, aging gaskets and shattering like ice on the ground. They must be replaced, a routine task complicated by the fact that no two of the 486 panels 6 have the same dimensions. The roughly 4 million custom-made ceramic tiles 7 that cover the terminal\\u2019s floors, walls, and steps are cracked and worn; many of them are being replaced.\\n6 Ike Edeani\\n\\u201cThe whole world is a giant Walgreens now,\\u201d Tyler Morse, the CEO of MCR, told me when I visited the terminal recently. \\u201cWhen you go to Paris, London, New York, or St. Louis, it\\u2019s the same restaurant chains, the same supermarkets. As the world becomes more homogenized, people become interested in a unique product.\\u201d\\n7 Ike Edeani\\nThis particular product will be not only unique but costly: With a budget of $265 million, it is likely to be the world\\u2019s most expensive airport hotel. Bulldozers are now digging out a 50,000-square-foot subterranean event space, which will sit below and behind the old terminal. Flanking the landmark will be two six-story buildings 8, which will hold the hotel\\u2019s 505 guest rooms (expected to start at about $250 a night), a rooftop swimming pool, and an observation deck, from which visitors will be able to watch planes take off.\",\n          \"Former FBI Director James Comey leaves a closed session with the Senate Intelligence Committee in the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill June 8, 2017 in Washington, D.C. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\\nFormer FBI Director James Comey sharply criticized Republicans, and by extension President Donald Trump, shortly after the House Intelligence Committee released the controversial memo that supposedly shows bias at the FBI and the Justice Department. It seems Comey, agrees with Slate\\u2019s Jeremy Stahl that the memo is a \\u201ccomplete flop\\u201d and \\u201coffers virtually no new information.\\u201d\\nIn a tweet, Comey point-blank asks: \\u201cThat\\u2019s it?\\u201d The partisan wrangling that preceded the release of the \\u201cdishonest and misleading\\u201d memo caused significant damage but doesn\\u2019t actually show any kind of malfeasance, the former FBI chief suggested. The debate over the document that has engulfed Washington for weeks \\u201cwrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen,\\u201d Comey wrote. \\u201cFor what? DOJ & FBI must keep doing their jobs.\\u201d\\nThat\\u2019s it? Dishonest and misleading memo wrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen. For what? DOJ & FBI must keep doing their jobs. \\u2014 James Comey (@Comey) February 2, 2018\\nThe normally quiet Comey who usually likes to comment on the news in roundabout ways has been unusually direct recently. On Thursday evening, the former FBI director also took to Twitter to say that everyone \\u201cshould appreciate the FBI speaking up.\\u201d Ultimately though, Comey, whose firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel, sounded an optimistic tone: \\u201cTake heart: American history shows that, in the long run, weasels and liars never hold the field, so long as good people stand up. Not a lot of schools or streets named for Joe McCarthy.\\u201d\\nAll should appreciate the FBI speaking up. I wish more of our leaders would. But take heart: American history shows that, in the long run, weasels and liars never hold the field, so long as good people stand up. Not a lot of schools or streets named for Joe McCarthy. \\u2014 James Comey (@Comey) February 1, 2018\\nThe FBI and Justice Department had staunchly opposed the release of the memo and there were reports that the White House was worried FBI Director Christopher Wray would resign with the release of the memo. But later reports claimed Wray had \\u201cno intention of quitting.\\u201d\\nBREAKING: FBI Director Chris Wray has no intention of quitting if controversial House Intel memo is released despite his objections, @PeteWilliamsNBC reports \\u2014 NBC Politics (@NBCPolitics) February 1, 2018\\nSome are urging the FBI director to reconsider.

Flynn resigned Monday night after reports he misled the vice president-elect about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.\\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\\nTwenty-five days - that's how long Michael Flynn lasted as national security adviser. New details are emerging today about his ouster. He now admits that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. At issue is whether he promised that the U.S. would ease sanctions imposed by the Obama administration.\\nKELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\\nWhite House Spokesman Sean Spicer said today President Trump asked for Flynn's resignation and got it.\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\\nSEAN SPICER: We got to a point not based on a legal issue but based on a trust issue where the level of trust between the president and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change.\\nMCEVERS: Flynn's departure leaves a vacuum at the top of the National Security Council. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly reports on the upheaval inside the NSC and what's not getting done with all of Washington distracted.\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Here's one way of looking at Flynn's departure. Maybe not much will change.\\nPHILIP GORDON: To be honest, even before Flynn's resignation, was scene at the NSC was fairly chaotic.\\nKELLY: That's Philip Gordon, a veteran of both the Obama and Clinton National Security Councils. He points to reports of dysfunction. Still, he says the national security adviser plays an essential role in briefing the president every day. Gordon says when the job is not filled or not filled well, you get trouble.\\nGORDON: If you just think about the inbox of the president today on Iran and Ukraine and the South China Sea and North Korean tests and Egypt and Yemen and Afghanistan and NAFTA and Islamic State strategy and safe zones in Syria, I mean you could go - the volume that goes across the national security adviser's desk is extraordinary. And every one of those issues is extraordinarily complicated and fraught with risk.\\nKELLY: Want an urgent example of what could go wrong without a steady national security adviser at the helm? Phil Gordon says look at tomorrow. Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu is visiting the White House. Sure, Gordon says Trump has other advisers to help him prep, but Trump will not benefit from the detailed and careful process that Gordon says is the signature of the NSC.\\nGORDON: And I can guarantee you that Prime Minister Netanyahu will be more prepared for the meeting than President Trump. You know, that leads to U.S. foreign policy mistakes.\\nKELLY: We should note there is an acting national security adviser in place. That's retired General Keith Kellogg. And Fran Townsend, veteran of George W. Bush's National Security Council, says it's nonsense to think that Flynn's absence will automatically lead the whole enterprise to go off the rails.\\nFRAN TOWNSEND: The business of the country continues to get done. It doesn't stop because one person walks out the door.\\nKELLY: Townsend served as President Bush's homeland security adviser. She says the timing of Flynn's resignation is unfortunate - just three weeks in. But she argues the palace intrigue won't have a serious impact.\\nTOWNSEND: This is Washington's favorite parlor game, right? I think we on the outside spend a lot more time on this sort of nonsense than you do when you have the nation's business that you're responsible for. I mean I just don't think the people - the substantive people in the White House have the luxury of the parlor game. They just don't.\\nKELLY: Townsend predicts calmer waters ahead for the Trump White House. Adam Schiff does not. He's the California congressman who's the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Schiff believes the Russia trail does not end with Michael Flynn, that it leads deeper and higher in the White House. Schiff says he's troubled in particular by this question.\\nADAM SCHIFF: Was Flynn acting at the president's behest? Was he acting with the president's knowledge?\\nKELLY: Because if that were true...\\nSCHIFF: Then you have the president of the United States, the prospect of the president of the United States lying to the public about contacts with one of the principal threats to the country, that being Russia. That's about as serious as it gets in the national security realm.\\nKELLY: Trump Spokesman Sean Spicer categorically denied this charge today, saying the president did not direct Flynn to talk about sanctions. That's a month and a day after Spicer categorically denied that Michael Flynn ever discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador. Mary Louise Kelly, NPR News, Washington.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2017 NPR.

Its form was inseparable from the thrill of transatlantic air travel. For a generation of international travelers, it was a memorable first impression of America, an Ellis Island for the jet age.\\nIt was the world\\u2019s most famous airport terminal 1, and the most beloved project of the mid-century architect Eero Saarinen 2. Likened to a bird taking off, the TWA Flight Center at New York\\u2019s Kennedy airport comprises four vaulted concrete shells perched lightly on the ground. There are few walls; instead, the exterior is dominated by canted banks of windows.\\nIn 1962, when its opening was broadcast on national TV, the Trans World Flight Center was the most distinctive example of corporate-showpiece architecture, a movement led by Saarinen himself, with projects such as the General Motors Technical Center, in Warren, Michigan, and IBM\\u2019s research center north of New York City. \\u201cLike a good advertising agency,\\u201d the critic Reyner Banham wrote of Saarinen that year, \\u201che bestowed status, improved the image.\\u201d\\nYet even as the terminal captured the futuristic spirit of the \\u201960s, it was soon rendered out-of-date by the demands of larger planes and crowds. Annexes were built to accommodate the jumbo jet; as security requirements changed, a phalanx of metal detectors was added, cutting the atrium in two and creating lines that sometimes stretched through the terminal\\u2019s doors. By the time TWA went out of business, in 2001, the building suffered from a predicament common to iconic mid-century architecture: It was too useless to live, and too beautiful to die.\\n4 Ike Edeani\\nFor the next 15 years, preservationists, developers, and the Port Authority\\u2014which manages the airport\\u2014engaged in a tug-of-war over the building\\u2019s future. Structurally inflexible and costly to restore, decaying mid-century landmarks by Paul Rudolph, Richard Neutra, and others were being demolished. If anything, the Flight Center seemed even less likely than these to survive. But in 2015, on its third attempt, the Port Authority finally found a developer willing to take a 75-year lease on the terminal. MCR Development, which owns dozens of hotels, proposed a restaurant-hotel-conference-center complex around the Flight Center; the project broke ground in December.\\n5 Phillip Harrington / Alamy\\nThere are some challenges to rehabilitating 4 a structure that has more in common with a sculpture 5 than with your average transportation facility. The panels of quarter-inch-thick, nontempered glass that form the building\\u2019s windows, for example, have been dropping from their brittle, aging gaskets and shattering like ice on the ground. They must be replaced, a routine task complicated by the fact that no two of the 486 panels 6 have the same dimensions. The roughly 4 million custom-made ceramic tiles 7 that cover the terminal\\u2019s floors, walls, and steps are cracked and worn; many of them are being replaced.\\n6 Ike Edeani\\n\\u201cThe whole world is a giant Walgreens now,\\u201d Tyler Morse, the CEO of MCR, told me when I visited the terminal recently. \\u201cWhen you go to Paris, London, New York, or St. Louis, it\\u2019s the same restaurant chains, the same supermarkets. As the world becomes more homogenized, people become interested in a unique product.\\u201d\\n7 Ike Edeani\\nThis particular product will be not only unique but costly: With a budget of $265 million, it is likely to be the world\\u2019s most expensive airport hotel. Bulldozers are now digging out a 50,000-square-foot subterranean event space, which will sit below and behind the old terminal. Flanking the landmark will be two six-story buildings 8, which will hold the hotel\\u2019s 505 guest rooms (expected to start at about $250 a night), a rooftop swimming pool, and an observation deck, from which visitors will be able to watch planes take off.\",\n          \"Former FBI Director James Comey leaves a closed session with the Senate Intelligence Committee in the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill June 8, 2017 in Washington, D.C. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\\nFormer FBI Director James Comey sharply criticized Republicans, and by extension President Donald Trump, shortly after the House Intelligence Committee released the controversial memo that supposedly shows bias at the FBI and the Justice Department. It seems Comey, agrees with Slate\\u2019s Jeremy Stahl that the memo is a \\u201ccomplete flop\\u201d and \\u201coffers virtually no new information.\\u201d\\nIn a tweet, Comey point-blank asks: \\u201cThat\\u2019s it?\\u201d The partisan wrangling that preceded the release of the \\u201cdishonest and misleading\\u201d memo caused significant damage but doesn\\u2019t actually show any kind of malfeasance, the former FBI chief suggested. The debate over the document that has engulfed Washington for weeks \\u201cwrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen,\\u201d Comey wrote. \\u201cFor what?

On Thursday evening, the former FBI director also took to Twitter to say that everyone \\u201cshould appreciate the FBI speaking up.\\u201d Ultimately though, Comey, whose firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel, sounded an optimistic tone: \\u201cTake heart: American history shows that, in the long run, weasels and liars never hold the field, so long as good people stand up. Not a lot of schools or streets named for Joe McCarthy.\\u201d\\nAll should appreciate the FBI speaking up. I wish more of our leaders would.

Flynn resigned Monday night after reports he misled the vice president-elect about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.\\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\\nTwenty-five days - that's how long Michael Flynn lasted as national security adviser. New details are emerging today about his ouster. He now admits that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. At issue is whether he promised that the U.S. would ease sanctions imposed by the Obama administration.\\nKELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\\nWhite House Spokesman Sean Spicer said today President Trump asked for Flynn's resignation and got it.\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\\nSEAN SPICER: We got to a point not based on a legal issue but based on a trust issue where the level of trust between the president and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change.\\nMCEVERS: Flynn's departure leaves a vacuum at the top of the National Security Council. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly reports on the upheaval inside the NSC and what's not getting done with all of Washington distracted.\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Here's one way of looking at Flynn's departure. Maybe not much will change.\\nPHILIP GORDON: To be honest, even before Flynn's resignation, was scene at the NSC was fairly chaotic.\\nKELLY: That's Philip Gordon, a veteran of both the Obama and Clinton National Security Councils. He points to reports of dysfunction. Still, he says the national security adviser plays an essential role in briefing the president every day. Gordon says when the job is not filled or not filled well, you get trouble.\\nGORDON: If you just think about the inbox of the president today on Iran and Ukraine and the South China Sea and North Korean tests and Egypt and Yemen and Afghanistan and NAFTA and Islamic State strategy and safe zones in Syria, I mean you could go - the volume that goes across the national security adviser's desk is extraordinary. And every one of those issues is extraordinarily complicated and fraught with risk.\\nKELLY: Want an urgent example of what could go wrong without a steady national security adviser at the helm? Phil Gordon says look at tomorrow. Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu is visiting the White House. Sure, Gordon says Trump has other advisers to help him prep, but Trump will not benefit from the detailed and careful process that Gordon says is the signature of the NSC.\\nGORDON: And I can guarantee you that Prime Minister Netanyahu will be more prepared for the meeting than President Trump. You know, that leads to U.S. foreign policy mistakes.\\nKELLY: We should note there is an acting national security adviser in place. That's retired General Keith Kellogg. And Fran Townsend, veteran of George W. Bush's National Security Council, says it's nonsense to think that Flynn's absence will automatically lead the whole enterprise to go off the rails.\\nFRAN TOWNSEND: The business of the country continues to get done. It doesn't stop because one person walks out the door.\\nKELLY: Townsend served as President Bush's homeland security adviser. She says the timing of Flynn's resignation is unfortunate - just three weeks in. But she argues the palace intrigue won't have a serious impact.\\nTOWNSEND: This is Washington's favorite parlor game, right? I think we on the outside spend a lot more time on this sort of nonsense than you do when you have the nation's business that you're responsible for. I mean I just don't think the people - the substantive people in the White House have the luxury of the parlor game. They just don't.\\nKELLY: Townsend predicts calmer waters ahead for the Trump White House. Adam Schiff does not. He's the California congressman who's the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Schiff believes the Russia trail does not end with Michael Flynn, that it leads deeper and higher in the White House. Schiff says he's troubled in particular by this question.\\nADAM SCHIFF: Was Flynn acting at the president's behest? Was he acting with the president's knowledge?\\nKELLY: Because if that were true...\\nSCHIFF: Then you have the president of the United States, the prospect of the president of the United States lying to the public about contacts with one of the principal threats to the country, that being Russia. That's about as serious as it gets in the national security realm.\\nKELLY: Trump Spokesman Sean Spicer categorically denied this charge today, saying the president did not direct Flynn to talk about sanctions. That's a month and a day after Spicer categorically denied that Michael Flynn ever discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador. Mary Louise Kelly, NPR News, Washington.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2017 NPR.

Its form was inseparable from the thrill of transatlantic air travel. For a generation of international travelers, it was a memorable first impression of America, an Ellis Island for the jet age.\\nIt was the world\\u2019s most famous airport terminal 1, and the most beloved project of the mid-century architect Eero Saarinen 2. Likened to a bird taking off, the TWA Flight Center at New York\\u2019s Kennedy airport comprises four vaulted concrete shells perched lightly on the ground. There are few walls; instead, the exterior is dominated by canted banks of windows.\\nIn 1962, when its opening was broadcast on national TV, the Trans World Flight Center was the most distinctive example of corporate-showpiece architecture, a movement led by Saarinen himself, with projects such as the General Motors Technical Center, in Warren, Michigan, and IBM\\u2019s research center north of New York City. \\u201cLike a good advertising agency,\\u201d the critic Reyner Banham wrote of Saarinen that year, \\u201che bestowed status, improved the image.\\u201d\\nYet even as the terminal captured the futuristic spirit of the \\u201960s, it was soon rendered out-of-date by the demands of larger planes and crowds. Annexes were built to accommodate the jumbo jet; as security requirements changed, a phalanx of metal detectors was added, cutting the atrium in two and creating lines that sometimes stretched through the terminal\\u2019s doors. By the time TWA went out of business, in 2001, the building suffered from a predicament common to iconic mid-century architecture: It was too useless to live, and too beautiful to die.\\n4 Ike Edeani\\nFor the next 15 years, preservationists, developers, and the Port Authority\\u2014which manages the airport\\u2014engaged in a tug-of-war over the building\\u2019s future. Structurally inflexible and costly to restore, decaying mid-century landmarks by Paul Rudolph, Richard Neutra, and others were being demolished. If anything, the Flight Center seemed even less likely than these to survive. But in 2015, on its third attempt, the Port Authority finally found a developer willing to take a 75-year lease on the terminal. MCR Development, which owns dozens of hotels, proposed a restaurant-hotel-conference-center complex around the Flight Center; the project broke ground in December.\\n5 Phillip Harrington / Alamy\\nThere are some challenges to rehabilitating 4 a structure that has more in common with a sculpture 5 than with your average transportation facility. The panels of quarter-inch-thick, nontempered glass that form the building\\u2019s windows, for example, have been dropping from their brittle, aging gaskets and shattering like ice on the ground. They must be replaced, a routine task complicated by the fact that no two of the 486 panels 6 have the same dimensions. The roughly 4 million custom-made ceramic tiles 7 that cover the terminal\\u2019s floors, walls, and steps are cracked and worn; many of them are being replaced.\\n6 Ike Edeani\\n\\u201cThe whole world is a giant Walgreens now,\\u201d Tyler Morse, the CEO of MCR, told me when I visited the terminal recently. \\u201cWhen you go to Paris, London, New York, or St. Louis, it\\u2019s the same restaurant chains, the same supermarkets. As the world becomes more homogenized, people become interested in a unique product.\\u201d\\n7 Ike Edeani\\nThis particular product will be not only unique but costly: With a budget of $265 million, it is likely to be the world\\u2019s most expensive airport hotel. Bulldozers are now digging out a 50,000-square-foot subterranean event space, which will sit below and behind the old terminal. Flanking the landmark will be two six-story buildings 8, which will hold the hotel\\u2019s 505 guest rooms (expected to start at about $250 a night), a rooftop swimming pool, and an observation deck, from which visitors will be able to watch planes take off.\",\n          \"Former FBI Director James Comey leaves a closed session with the Senate Intelligence Committee in the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill June 8, 2017 in Washington, D.C.

Flynn resigned Monday night after reports he misled the vice president-elect about his conversations with the Russian ambassador.\\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\\nTwenty-five days - that's how long Michael Flynn lasted as national security adviser. New details are emerging today about his ouster. He now admits that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. At issue is whether he promised that the U.S. would ease sanctions imposed by the Obama administration.\\nKELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\\nWhite House Spokesman Sean Spicer said today President Trump asked for Flynn's resignation and got it.\\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\\nSEAN SPICER: We got to a point not based on a legal issue but based on a trust issue where the level of trust between the president and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change.\\nMCEVERS: Flynn's departure leaves a vacuum at the top of the National Security Council. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly reports on the upheaval inside the NSC and what's not getting done with all of Washington distracted.\\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Here's one way of looking at Flynn's departure. Maybe not much will change.\\nPHILIP GORDON: To be honest, even before Flynn's resignation, was scene at the NSC was fairly chaotic.\\nKELLY: That's Philip Gordon, a veteran of both the Obama and Clinton National Security Councils. He points to reports of dysfunction. Still, he says the national security adviser plays an essential role in briefing the president every day. Gordon says when the job is not filled or not filled well, you get trouble.\\nGORDON: If you just think about the inbox of the president today on Iran and Ukraine and the South China Sea and North Korean tests and Egypt and Yemen and Afghanistan and NAFTA and Islamic State strategy and safe zones in Syria, I mean you could go - the volume that goes across the national security adviser's desk is extraordinary. And every one of those issues is extraordinarily complicated and fraught with risk.\\nKELLY: Want an urgent example of what could go wrong without a steady national security adviser at the helm? Phil Gordon says look at tomorrow. Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu is visiting the White House. Sure, Gordon says Trump has other advisers to help him prep, but Trump will not benefit from the detailed and careful process that Gordon says is the signature of the NSC.\\nGORDON: And I can guarantee you that Prime Minister Netanyahu will be more prepared for the meeting than President Trump. You know, that leads to U.S. foreign policy mistakes.\\nKELLY: We should note there is an acting national security adviser in place. That's retired General Keith Kellogg. And Fran Townsend, veteran of George W. Bush's National Security Council, says it's nonsense to think that Flynn's absence will automatically lead the whole enterprise to go off the rails.\\nFRAN TOWNSEND: The business of the country continues to get done. It doesn't stop because one person walks out the door.\\nKELLY: Townsend served as President Bush's homeland security adviser. She says the timing of Flynn's resignation is unfortunate - just three weeks in. But she argues the palace intrigue won't have a serious impact.\\nTOWNSEND: This is Washington's favorite parlor game, right? I think we on the outside spend a lot more time on this sort of nonsense than you do when you have the nation's business that you're responsible for. I mean I just don't think the people - the substantive people in the White House have the luxury of the parlor game. They just don't.\\nKELLY: Townsend predicts calmer waters ahead for the Trump White House. Adam Schiff does not. He's the California congressman who's the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Schiff believes the Russia trail does not end with Michael Flynn, that it leads deeper and higher in the White House. Schiff says he's troubled in particular by this question.\\nADAM SCHIFF: Was Flynn acting at the president's behest? Was he acting with the president's knowledge?\\nKELLY: Because if that were true...\\nSCHIFF: Then you have the president of the United States, the prospect of the president of the United States lying to the public about contacts with one of the principal threats to the country, that being Russia. That's about as serious as it gets in the national security realm.\\nKELLY: Trump Spokesman Sean Spicer categorically denied this charge today, saying the president did not direct Flynn to talk about sanctions. That's a month and a day after Spicer categorically denied that Michael Flynn ever discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador. Mary Louise Kelly, NPR News, Washington.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2017 NPR.

Its form was inseparable from the thrill of transatlantic air travel. For a generation of international travelers, it was a memorable first impression of America, an Ellis Island for the jet age.\\nIt was the world\\u2019s most famous airport terminal 1, and the most beloved project of the mid-century architect Eero Saarinen 2. Likened to a bird taking off, the TWA Flight Center at New York\\u2019s Kennedy airport comprises four vaulted concrete shells perched lightly on the ground. There are few walls; instead, the exterior is dominated by canted banks of windows.\\nIn 1962, when its opening was broadcast on national TV, the Trans World Flight Center was the most distinctive example of corporate-showpiece architecture, a movement led by Saarinen himself, with projects such as the General Motors Technical Center, in Warren, Michigan, and IBM\\u2019s research center north of New York City. \\u201cLike a good advertising agency,\\u201d the critic Reyner Banham wrote of Saarinen that year, \\u201che bestowed status, improved the image.\\u201d\\nYet even as the terminal captured the futuristic spirit of the \\u201960s, it was soon rendered out-of-date by the demands of larger planes and crowds. Annexes were built to accommodate the jumbo jet; as security requirements changed, a phalanx of metal detectors was added, cutting the atrium in two and creating lines that sometimes stretched through the terminal\\u2019s doors. By the time TWA went out of business, in 2001, the building suffered from a predicament common to iconic mid-century architecture: It was too useless to live, and too beautiful to die.\\n4 Ike Edeani\\nFor the next 15 years, preservationists, developers, and the Port Authority\\u2014which manages the airport\\u2014engaged in a tug-of-war over the building\\u2019s future. Structurally inflexible and costly to restore, decaying mid-century landmarks by Paul Rudolph, Richard Neutra, and others were being demolished. If anything, the Flight Center seemed even less likely than these to survive. But in 2015, on its third attempt, the Port Authority finally found a developer willing to take a 75-year lease on the terminal. MCR Development, which owns dozens of hotels, proposed a restaurant-hotel-conference-center complex around the Flight Center; the project broke ground in December.\\n5 Phillip Harrington / Alamy\\nThere are some challenges to rehabilitating 4 a structure that has more in common with a sculpture 5 than with your average transportation facility. The panels of quarter-inch-thick, nontempered glass that form the building\\u2019s windows, for example, have been dropping from their brittle, aging gaskets and shattering like ice on the ground. They must be replaced, a routine task complicated by the fact that no two of the 486 panels 6 have the same dimensions. The roughly 4 million custom-made ceramic tiles 7 that cover the terminal\\u2019s floors, walls, and steps are cracked and worn; many of them are being replaced.\\n6 Ike Edeani\\n\\u201cThe whole world is a giant Walgreens now,\\u201d Tyler Morse, the CEO of MCR, told me when I visited the terminal recently. \\u201cWhen you go to Paris, London, New York, or St. Louis, it\\u2019s the same restaurant chains, the same supermarkets. As the world becomes more homogenized, people become interested in a unique product.\\u201d\\n7 Ike Edeani\\nThis particular product will be not only unique but costly: With a budget of $265 million, it is likely to be the world\\u2019s most expensive airport hotel. Bulldozers are now digging out a 50,000-square-foot subterranean event space, which will sit below and behind the old terminal. Flanking the landmark will be two six-story buildings 8, which will hold the hotel\\u2019s 505 guest rooms (expected to start at about $250 a night), a rooftop swimming pool, and an observation deck, from which visitors will be able to watch planes take off.\",\n          \"Former FBI Director James Comey leaves a closed session with the Senate Intelligence Committee in the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill June 8, 2017 in Washington, D.C. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\\nFormer FBI Director James Comey sharply criticized Republicans, and by extension President Donald Trump, shortly after the House Intelligence Committee released the controversial memo that supposedly shows bias at the FBI and the Justice Department. It seems Comey, agrees with Slate\\u2019s Jeremy Stahl that the memo is a \\u201ccomplete flop\\u201d and \\u201coffers virtually no new information.\\u201d\\nIn a tweet, Comey point-blank asks: \\u201cThat\\u2019s it?\\u201d The partisan wrangling that preceded the release of the \\u201cdishonest and misleading\\u201d memo caused significant damage but doesn\\u2019t actually show any kind of malfeasance, the former FBI chief suggested. The debate over the document that has engulfed Washington for weeks \\u201cwrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen,\\u201d Comey wrote. \\u201cFor what? DOJ & FBI must keep doing their jobs.\\u201d\\nThat\\u2019s it? Dishonest and misleading memo wrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen. For what? DOJ & FBI must keep doing their jobs. \\u2014 James Comey (@Comey) February 2, 2018\\nThe normally quiet Comey who usually likes to comment on the news in roundabout ways has been unusually direct recently. On Thursday evening, the former FBI director also took to Twitter to say that everyone \\u201cshould appreciate the FBI speaking up.\\u201d Ultimately though, Comey, whose firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel, sounded an optimistic tone: \\u201cTake heart: American history shows that, in the long run, weasels and liars never hold the field, so long as good people stand up. Not a lot of schools or streets named for Joe McCarthy.\\u201d\\nAll should appreciate the FBI speaking up. I wish more of our leaders would. But take heart: American history shows that, in the long run, weasels and liars never hold the field, so long as good people stand up. Not a lot of schools or streets named for Joe McCarthy. \\u2014 James Comey (@Comey) February 1, 2018\\nThe FBI and Justice Department had staunchly opposed the release of the memo and there were reports that the White House was worried FBI Director Christopher Wray would resign with the release of the memo. But later reports claimed Wray had \\u201cno intention of quitting.\\u201d\\nBREAKING: FBI Director Chris Wray has no intention of quitting if controversial House Intel memo is released despite his objections, @PeteWilliamsNBC reports \\u2014 NBC Politics (@NBCPolitics) February 1, 2018\\nSome are urging the FBI director to reconsider.

In 2017, Mohammad bin Salman was named as the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, and he has since been widely recognized as the heir apparent to the Saudi throne. He has been a key figure in the country's government and has played a significant role in shaping its domestic and foreign policies.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the succession of the Saudi Arabian crown is a matter of great importance and sensitivity, and it is not appropriate to make any assumptions or predictions about the future of the kingdom. The Saudi royal family has a long history of resolving succession issues through a careful and deliberate process, and it is likely that they will continue to do so in the future.\\n\\nI hope this information is helpful.

The United States has a complex set of federal and state laws regulating the sale, ownership, and use of firearms. Here are some key points:\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udd2b Federal Law: The Gun Control Act of 1968 and the National Firearms Act of 1934 regulate the sale and possession of firearms. These laws prohibit certain individuals, such as convicted felons and the mentally ill, from owning or possessing firearms. Additionally, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 established a background check system for firearms purchasers.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udd2b State Law: Each state has its own set of gun laws, which can be more restrictive than federal laws. Some states have laws that prohibit the possession of certain types of firearms, such as assault weapons or large capacity ammunition feeding devices. Other states have laws that require a permit to carry a concealed weapon or to purchase a firearm.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udd2b Background Checks: Federal law requires background checks for all firearms purchasers, including those purchasing from private sellers. These checks are conducted through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and are intended to prevent the sale of firearms to prohibited persons, such as convicted felons and the mentally ill.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udd2b Age Limits: Federal law prohibits the sale of firearms to individuals under the age of 18, and some states have raised the minimum age to 21 or older.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udd2b Waiting Periods: Some states have laws that require a waiting period before a firearm can be purchased or transferred. These waiting periods can range from a few days to several weeks.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udd2b magazine capacity restrictions: Some states have laws that restrict the capacity of magazines, limiting the number of rounds that can be loaded into a firearm.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udd2b Open Carry: Some states allow individuals to openly carry firearms in public, while others prohibit open carry.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udd2b Concealed Carry: Some states allow individuals to carry concealed firearms with a valid permit, while others prohibit concealed carry.\\n\\nIt's important to note that gun laws can change over time, and it's always a good idea to check with your local authorities or a legal professional for the most up-to-date information on gun laws in your area. \\ud83d\\udc4d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"LLAMA_13B_rr_flag\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0\",\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"LLAMA_response_70B\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 198,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Mohammad bin Salman, also known as MBS, became the heir to the Saudi Arabian crown in 2017.

He had previously served as the minister of defense and had been instrumental in leading Saudi Arabia's military intervention in Yemen. His appointment as crown prince was seen as a sign of his father's confidence in his abilities and a recognition of his leadership potential.\\n\\nAs crown prince, MBS has continued to push for significant reforms in Saudi Arabia.

The Second Amendment to the US Constitution protects the right to bear arms, and many Americans view gun ownership as a constitutional right. However, there are also laws and regulations in place to ensure public safety and prevent gun violence.\\n\\nFederal laws prohibit certain individuals from possessing firearms, including convicted felons, domestic abusers, and the mentally ill. Additionally, federal law requires background checks for firearms purchasers, and there are restrictions on the sale and possession of certain types of firearms, such as automatic weapons and short-barreled shotguns.\\n\\nState laws vary widely, with some states having strict regulations on gun ownership and others having more lenient laws. Some states require a permit to carry a concealed weapon, while others do not. Some states also have laws that allow individuals to carry firearms openly.\\n\\nThere have been numerous efforts to reform gun laws in the US, particularly in response to mass shootings and other gun violence incidents. However, efforts to pass comprehensive gun control legislation have been met with resistance from gun rights advocates who argue that such laws would infringe upon their Second Amendment rights.\\n\\nIt's important to note that the issue of gun control is highly polarized, with strong opinions on both sides. While some argue for stricter gun laws to prevent gun violence, others argue that such laws would not effectively address the issue and would infringe upon their rights.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"LLAMA_70B_rr_flag\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1\",\n          \"0B\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"GPT3_response_175B\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 198,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Mohammad bin Salman, commonly known as MBS, has become a prominent figure in the Saudi Arabian political landscape since being named the Crown Prince in June 2017.

His rapid rise to power and his ambitious reforms have garnered both praise and criticism from around the world.\\n\\nOne of the most notable aspects of MBS's leadership is his ambitious Vision 2030 plan, which aims to diversify the Saudi economy away from its dependence on oil. The plan includes efforts to privatize government assets, attract foreign investment, and develop new industries such as tourism and entertainment. MBS has also implemented social reforms in Saudi Arabia, such as lifting the ban on women driving and granting them more rights in society.\\n\\nDespite his reform efforts, MBS has faced criticism for his handling of various domestic and international issues. One of the most controversial events during his tenure as Crown Prince was the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. The incident sparked international outrage and raised questions about MBS's commitment to human rights and press freedom.\\n\\nMBS has also faced criticism for his role in the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, which has led to a humanitarian crisis in the country.

Prior to this significant elevation, he held various significant positions, both helping to administer and profoundly shaping his country's future and signaling a generational shift in the leadership of the kingdom. His rise reflects broader trends in Saudi society, including the demands of its youthful population and the need for economic rejuvenation amidst sustained low oil prices.\\n\\nMohammad bin Salman was first named Deputy Crown Prince in 2015, shortly after his father, King Salman, ascended to the throne. This position immediately put him in the limelight and hinted at his future ascent. Interestingly, his rise involved leapfrogging over the then Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, a veteran security chief credited with the crackdown on al-Qaeda in the kingdom\\u2014 a move seen as both audacious and fraught with risks. This distinctive shift in royal succession pointed to a major realignment of internal power dynamics within the House of Saud and heralded a departure from established succession norms, traditionally characterized by aging leadership and steadily increasing conservatism.\\n\\nAs Crown Prince, bin Salman oversaw an aggressive domestic reform agenda known as Vision 2030, which aimed at diversifying the Saudi economy away from oil dependence and cultivating a more modern, entrepreneurial state. Vision 2030 included extensive social reforms, such as lifting the ban on women driving, curbing the powers of the religious police, and introducing public entertainment such as concerts and cinemas. These reforms, earning both domestic acclaim and international intrigue, seemed directed both at liberalizing the conservative state and securing economic and social sustainability by aligning the country\\u2019s governance with the values and expectations of its young population, which comprises over half of the national demographic.\\n\\nInternationally, Mohammad bin Salman has sought to reposition Saudi Arabia as a dominant regional power with broader global influence. He has been pivotal in escalating the country's assertiveness across the Middle East, evidenced by its direct engagement in the Yemen conflict and a blockade of Qatar, ostensibly over its alleged support for terrorism. However, these actions have also exposed Saudi Arabia to widespread criticism and highlighted significant strategic and humanitarian challenges. These events have formed key aspects of his foreign policy approach, which is seen as more hawkish compared to the traditional diplomatic posture of the kingdom.\\n\\nHowever, Mohammad bin Salman's tenure has not been without controversy. The international outlook on his leadership was particularly challenged following the 2018 assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist critical of bin Salman\\u2019s regime, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. This incident provoked a global uproar, significantly tarnishing his image and calling into question his earlier liberal reformative narrative. The subsequent handling of the crisis, marked by denials and questionable accountability within the Saudi hierarchy, exposed critical vulnerabilities in his approach to governance and diplomacy.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the ascendancy of Mohammad bin Salman to the role of Crown Prince in 2017 marked a pivotal juncture in the history of Saudi Arabia. It not only underscored a significant shift in leadership style and generational transition within the royal family but also catalyzed profound transformations within the kingdom and its position on the global stage. While he has been a figure of significant reform and modernization, his methods and the repercussions of his policies continue to draw intense scrutiny and polarize opinion, both domestically and internationally. His future leadership will likely continue to be characterized by attempts to balance ambitious socioeconomic reforms with the challenges of political and regional stability.\",\n          \"U.S. gun laws primarily focus on regulating the sale, possession, and use of firearms and ammunition. The laws vary significantly across different states, and are also influenced by federal regulations. Below is an overview of key aspects related to US gun laws as of my last knowledge update in 2023:\\n\\n### Federal Laws\\n1. **Background Checks:** Under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, background checks are required for gun purchases from licensed dealers. This involves checking the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to ensure there are no criminal convictions or other disqualifying factors.\\n  \\n2. **Firearm Categories:** Certain types of firearms, like machine guns, suppressors, and short-barreled rifles, are regulated by the National Firearms Act (NFA) of 1934, and the Gun Control Act of 1968 likewise imposes stricter regulations on these and other firearms.\\n\\n3. **Minimum Age Requirements:** Under federal law, the minimum age to purchase handguns from a licensed dealer is 21, while for shotguns and rifles, the minimum age is 18.\\n\\n4. **Prohibited Persons:** Federal law prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those with felony convictions, certain domestic abusers, the mentally ill, and individuals with dishonorable discharges from the military.\\n\\n### State Laws\\nState laws complement and sometimes go beyond federal regulations, creating a patchwork of rules that can significantly vary. For example:\\n\\n1. **Permit Requirements:** Some states require permits to purchase firearms, while others do not. For instance, California has strict regulations including a safety certificate and waiting period, while Texas has more lenient laws.\\n\\n2. **Concealed and Open Carry:** States differ on whether they allow open carry, concealed carry, or both. They also vary regarding whether a permit is required for carrying firearms in public. States fall into categories like \\\"shall-issue,\\\" where permits must be granted if the person meets the legal criteria, \\\"may-issue,\\\" where considerable discretion is exercised, or \\\"constitutional carry,\\\" where no permit is needed.\\n\\n3. **Assault Weapons Bans:** Some states, like California and New York, have bans or severe restrictions on what they classify as \\\"assault weapons,\\\" which generally include certain semi-automatic firearms with military-style features. Other states have no such bans.\\n\\n4. **Red Flag Laws:** Also known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs), these laws allow courts to temporarily remove a person's firearms if they are deemed a risk to themselves or others. These laws exist in several states.\\n\\n5. **Castle Doctrine and Stand Your Ground Laws:** Several states have laws that allow individuals to use force, including deadly force, in defense of home (Castle Doctrine), or allow individuals to stand their ground and use force in self-defense without the duty to retreat, if they fear for their life.\\n\\n6. **Magazine Capacity Limits:** Some states set limits on the size of ammunition magazines, generally around 10 to 15 rounds, particularly for handguns and some types of rifles.\\n\\n### Court Rulings\\nThe interpretation of the Second Amendment, which guarantees the right to keep and bear arms, has been central in many legal debates and court cases, most notably the Supreme Court decisions in \\\"District of Columbia v. Heller\\\" (2008) and \\\"McDonald v. City of Chicago\\\" (2010). These rulings emphasized an individual's right to possess firearms at home for self-defense.\\n\\n### Ongoing Debates and Reforms\\nGun control remains a highly contentious issue in American politics. Debates often intensify after incidents of mass shootings, leading to calls for stricter gun control measures, such as universal background checks, national gun registries, or bans on certain types of firearms. Others argue these measures infringe on Second Amendment rights and advocate for less restrictive laws.\\n\\nGiven the variability and evolution of gun laws, individuals must consult the specific regulations applicable in their states and keep abreast of national legislative changes to fully understand their rights and responsibilities regarding firearm ownership and use.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"GPT3_1.76T_rr_flag\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0\",\n          \"0A\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":84}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Now we clean our data in the **exact same way as we cleaned the data training our classifier model**.
