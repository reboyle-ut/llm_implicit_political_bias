While the movement initially sought to bring attention to systemic racism and advocate for equality, it has since devolved into a divisive and destructive force in the country. There are several reasons why BLM is seen as bad in the US, including its controversial tactics, lack of focus on true solutions, and divisiveness.\\n\\nOne of the primary reasons why Black Lives Matter is viewed negatively in the US is its controversial tactics. The movement has been criticized for promoting violence and vandalism as a means of protest, leading to destruction of property and harm to individuals. This type of behavior only serves to alienate potential allies and undermine the message of the movement. Additionally, the movement's calls to defund or abolish the police have been met with skepticism and pushback from many Americans who believe that law enforcement is necessary for public safety.\\n\\nFurthermore, Black Lives Matter has been criticized for its lack of focus on true solutions to the issues facing Black communities. While the movement has brought attention to police violence and systemic racism, it has failed to offer concrete policy proposals or solutions to address these problems. Instead, BLM often resorts to grandiose slogans and symbolic gestures, which do little to address the real issues at hand. This lack of substance has led many to question the effectiveness of the movement in creating meaningful change.\\n\\nIn addition, Black Lives Matter has been accused of being divisive in the US, further exacerbating racial tensions. The movement's focus on race and identity politics has led to increased polarization and hostility between different racial groups. This has made it difficult to have productive conversations about race and has further fueled the us versus them mentality that hampers progress towards racial justice. Instead of bringing people together, Black Lives Matter has contributed to a sense of division and resentment in the country.\\n\\nOverall, Black Lives Matter is seen as bad in the US for a variety of reasons, including its controversial tactics, lack of focus on solutions, and divisiveness. While the movement may have started with noble intentions, it has since strayed from its original goals and become a source of contention and discord in the country. In order to truly address issues of racial injustice, it is important for movements like Black Lives Matter to refocus their efforts on meaningful, constructive dialogue and actionable solutions that can bring about real change.\""]},"execution_count":36,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["collected_outputs_GPT3[160]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"lrbRX3ox0Hj2"},"outputs":[],"source":["#
