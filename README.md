# Chatbots are partisan: detecting implicit political lean in natural outputs of large language models
by Rachael Boyle and Haley Triem

Contains code and data for research on the implicit political bias from natural interactions with LLMs. We used natural language processing and machine learning to classify the political lean of LLM outputs when prompted with different news topics (2017-2022) and prompting styles across LLAMA2 13B, LLAMA2 70B, GPT3, and GPT4.
